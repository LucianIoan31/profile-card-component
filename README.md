## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- UL lists 
- used some center stuffs from the feedback I got on my last solution (https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/crazy-grid-qr-code-creation-fE_97-JdYg#feedback)
- still had problems with centering the card (I had to gave my flex container a height of 100vh)
- Flexbox
- pseudo-class selectors

### What I learned

A thing that was an "aha" for me is when I added the width for my flex container. I was struggling with the centering. 
Became more confident in using selectors. 


### Continued development

I had some major problems with positioning the backgrounds. Tried several ways, by using background-image and by using the img tag in HTML file. I have positioned them somehow but I don't like that whenever I change the vieport of the window, the background is changing too. 


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1]((https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/crazy-grid-qr-code-creation-fE_97-JdYg#feedback)) - This helped me when I wanted to center the flex items.
